### Intro

This repository is my solution in `Python3.11.7` to the 2015 Advent of Code event. The solutions were written in late 2023 and early 2024 after the completion of the 2023 Advent of Code.

### Results

All results were >24h as they were completed after the event.

### File Structure

```txt
root/
├─ .github/workflow/actions.yml     -> YAML file that updates the badges on README.md
├─ .venv/                           -> Python virtual environment supporting files
├─ day_<N>/                         -> <N> = day number
│  ├─ input.txt                     -> User-specific input (removed)
│  └─ part_<M>.py                   -> Solution in Python; <M> = part number
├─ requirements.txt                 -> Package information for pip
├─ README.md                        -> Main docs
└─ .gitignore
```

### Python Virtual Environment Usage

1. To create the virtual environment and install the packages:

    ```bash
    virtualenv .venv --python=3.11
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. To activate the virtual invironment:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. To exit the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

### Experience

This is the second Advent of Code event that I had attempted. Compared to the puzzles from 2023, there seemed to be much more number theory puzzles. See the Notable Topics section below for topics that were interesting and new to me.
